***USES PYGAME***

Your world is being attacked by Aliens because of all the pollution is space.
The Aliens are throwing meteors, satelites, and much more your job is to stop the objects from hitting earth.
You have a basket and have to catch the trash using it, if you let the trash hit earth 3 times, the world dies
Each level there's more trash coming in, but every 3 levels that are completed you get a power up
You can either make your basket bigger or reduce the damge of each object hitting the earth making it so that
it takes 4 objects to destroy the world. For every 6 levels completed you are rewarded one medal, but another
comes up. with the same format but different storyline, win another 6 levels and you get another medal.
This repeats one more time, and if you are able to get the third medal you win the game.
Features:
- Pause feature
- Check your medals in the pause menu (only if you have a medal you can check)
- Power ups you can make the basket bigger or increase your lives per level
- basket moves with mouse
- Each level gets harder progressively,
- Different backgrounds depending on the part of the game you are on
- Trash falls from random positions
- Writing is uneven so that it can give off the mood of the game
